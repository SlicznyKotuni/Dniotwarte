The new wheel design should feature:
- A dark background with a gradient effect, transitioning from deep blue to black.
- Bright, colorful segments for each category, using colors like teal, purple, and orange.
- Visual effects such as a glowing outline around the wheel and subtle animations to enhance the spinning effect.
- Clear, bold text for category names on each segment, ensuring readability against the dark background.
